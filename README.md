It's one thing to question your mind; it's another to question your eyes and ears. 
But, then again, isn't it all the same? Our senses just mediocre inputs to our brain? 
Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us, but what 
if the haunting truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all, 
but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a truly 
fuzzy picture we will never make out
